    It is estimated that over 1.5 million college and university Adventist students are studying on non-Adventist public and private campuses around the world. According to University World News, “the number of students around the globe enrolled in higher education is forecast to more than double to 262 million by 2025.” Colleges and universities have become one of the most strategic mission fields in the world.

    PCM (Seventh-day Adventist Public Campus Ministries) envisions to inspire and transform Seventh-day Adventist students into campus ambassadors through intentional mentoring and discipleship. To this end, PCM will provide a ministry presence and nurturing environment for students, both on campuses and in local churches, utilizing communities of mentors who are committed in caring and mentoring/discipling the students. PCM plans to educate, equip, and empower students, PCM leaders, and mentors to be ambassadors, messengers, and missionaries of Christ, practicing His compassion and selfless and self-sacrificial service in their churches, campuses, and communities.
